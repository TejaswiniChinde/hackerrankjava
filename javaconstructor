constructors:a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

There are two rules defined for the constructor.

*Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
*A Constructor must have no explicit return type.
*A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.
*There are two types of constructors in Java:
*Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
*Parameterized constructor
DefaultConstructor:
A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
example:
class Bike1{  
//creating a default constructor  
Bike1(){System.out.println("Bike is created");}  
//main method  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//calling a default constructor  
Bike1 b=new Bike1();  
}  
}
