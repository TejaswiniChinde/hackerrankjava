50-50 rule
Schools of Chefland use the 50−50 rule to grade their students. As per the rule , students are awarded :
Z grade, if their attendance is strictly less than 50%
F grade, if they score strictly less than 50% marks, given that their attendance is greater than or equal to 50% .
A grade, otherwise.
You are given two integers, �X and �Y, denoting the percentage of attendance and percentage of marks obtained by Alice. What grade will Alice get?
