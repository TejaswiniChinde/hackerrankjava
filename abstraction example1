ABSTRACT CLASS:
Abstraction is nothing but a hiding some details and showing only the details that are necessary.
i)An abstract method is method without body.
ii)Abstract methods can be created by adding a keyword ‘abstract’ in front of the method.
iii)If a class contains at least one abstract method then you have to make the class also as abstract.
iv)You cannot create instance of abstract class.
v)Abstract classes can also contain concrete methods (methods with body).
vi)The major use abstract classes can be used in inheritance. a class which inherits from an abstract class should provide the implementation of the abstract method.
example program:
abstract class Animals{
    abstract void introduce();
}
class Catas extends Animals{
    void introduce(){
        System.out.println("Hey,I'm a Cat");
    }
}
class Elephant extends Animals{
    void introduce(){
        System.out.println("Hey,I'm an Elephant");
    }
}


public class Exp1abstract{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    Catas c1=new Catas();
    c1.introduce();
    }
}
output:
Hey, I'm a Cat
