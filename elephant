An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0
and his friend's house is located at point x (x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can
move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he needs
to make in order to get to his friend's house.
Note: Check out the Sample I/O for more clarity.

Explanation:
For Input 2,
Elephant can move 5 positions forwards in 1st step, 5 more positions forward in 2nd step, and 2
positions forward in 3rd step to reach point 12. So a total of 3 steps is required.
For Input 5,
Elephant can reach point 25 in just 5 steps by moving 5 positions forward in each step. From where
only 1 more step (4 positions forward) is required to reach point 29
